# inventory
My client wanted to automate the work at the warehouse using barcode scanners.
Also, for proper accounting of goods it was necessary to ensure the possibility of accounting by expiration date so that goods with the closest expiring date were sold first.

To work with all types of devices it was necessary to implement a web interface.
The client wanted that a database work on MSSQL and the Web server be deployed on the Alpine Linux.

My responsibilities: 
- Advising the client on selecting which technology stack to be used 
- Developing the entire PHP backend 
- Coding the frontend UI 
- Installing packages in Alpine Linux to work with SQL queries from PHP 


Technology stack used: 
- PHP 
- MSSQL 
- JavaScript
- JQuery 
- Ajax
- jTable.org - a JQuery plugin to create AJAX based CRUD tables
